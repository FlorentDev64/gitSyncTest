# Test Repo
This repo is a test to see how we can handle git sync with DSS.

# Steps done so far

1. Create a repo on github
2. Add the README.md from DSS
3. Sync from DSS to github
4. Import the lib (from sync by plugin) into PyCharm
5. Modify the README.md  (Can't sync with git, as the library folder does not contain ``.git`` directory.)
6. Sync with DSS.
7. From DSS: Modify the README and Push to github.
8. Modify the README.md (in DSS, while branch has been create from github, and the file hase been modified from Pycharm)
9. Commit and push from DSS
